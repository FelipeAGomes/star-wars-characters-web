# Star Wars Characters Web

# Introduction
Welcome to the Star Wars Character Viewer, a web application that utilizes Vue.js 3 with Quasar on the front-end and .NET on the back-end to consume the Star Wars API. This application allows for listing, pagination, displaying details, and searching characters from the renowned Star Wars saga.

# Features
Character Listing
The main page displays a paginated list of Star Wars characters. Pagination allows you to navigate through multiple pages of characters.

## Character Details
Clicking on a character from the list displays a detailed page with more in-depth information about the character.

## Name Search
The search bar allows you to search for characters by name. The search is dynamic, returning results as you type. If the full name is not entered, the API will return all characters that contain the entered substring.
